abstract = {{In a bacterial population, the cell-to-cell communication using chemical molecule as a signal in order to perform a collective task is called as quorum sensing. This communicating mechanism regulates the gene expression depending on the population density and dictates the fate of a cell. Quorum sensing regulates gene expression of important traits such as the production of extracellular polysaccharides, enzymes, antibiotics, siderophores, and pigments, virulence, motility, biofilm formation, bio-luminescence, competence, conjugation, sporulation and symbiosis. In order to control these physiological activities that are harmful to the host like humans, animals and plants, understanding of how the quorum sensing phenomenon regulates the gene expression is essential. In this review paper, we have discussed about the mathematical modelling framework used to capture quorum sensing phenomenon. These frameworks are based on the consideration of various factors such as spatial constrains, production of common good and population dynamics. These framework can be simulated using either deterministic modelling approach when average behavior of the population is sufficient to study quorum sensing or stochastic modelling approach when variation in quorum sensing among the individuals in a population occurs.}},

How their fate is determined is a topic of much recent research, with candidates including asymmetric cell division, lineage priming, stochastic assignment, and microenvironment instruction. Here we manipulate the generation of plasmablasts from B lymphocytes in vitro by varying CD40 stimulation strength to determine its influence on potential sources of fate control. Using long-term live cell imaging, we directly measure times to differentiate, divide, and die of hundreds of pairs of sibling cells. These data reveal that while the allocation of fates is significantly altered by signal strength, the proportion of siblings identified with asymmetric fates is unchanged. In contrast, we find that plasmablast generation is enhanced by slowing times to divide, which is consistent with a hypothesis of competing timed stochastic fate outcomes. We conclude that this mechanistically simple source of alternative fate regulation is important, and that useful quantitative models of signal integration can be developed based on its principles.}},

Whether B cell population dynamics are based on stochastic competition between competing cell fates, as in the development of competence by the bacteriumBacillus subtilis, or on deterministic cell fate decisions that execute a predictable program, as during the development of the wormCaenorhabditis elegans, remains unclear. Here, we developed long-term live-cell microscopy of B cell population expansion and multiscale mechanistic computational modeling to characterize the role of molecular noise in determining phenotype heterogeneity. We show that the cell lineage trees underlying B cell population dynamics are mediated by a largely predictable decision-making process where the heterogeneity of cell proliferation and death decisions at any given timepoint largely derives from nongenetic heterogeneity in the founder cells. This means that contrary to previous models, only a minority of genetically identical founder cells contribute the majority to the population response. We computationally predict and experimentally confirm nongenetic molecular determinants that are predictive of founder cells' proliferative capacity. While founder cell heterogeneity may arise from different exposure histories, we show that it may also be due to the gradual accumulation of small amounts of intrinsic noise during the lineage differentiation process of hematopoietic stem cells to mature B cells. Our finding of the largely deterministic nature of B lymphocyte responses may provide opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic development.}},

In this study, we introduce a novel, accessible, high-throughput method for measuring familial fate changes with accompanying statistical tools for testing hypotheses. The method combines multiplexing of division tracking dyes with detection of phenotypic markers to reveal clonal lineage properties. We illustrate the method by studying in vitro-activated mouse CD8+ T cell cultures, reporting division and phenotypic changes at the level of families.

abstract = {{The stochastic simulation algorithm commonly known as Gillespie’s algorithm (originally derived for modelling well-mixed systems of chemical reactions) is now used ubiquitously in the modelling of biological processes in which stochastic effects play an important role. In well-mixed scenarios at the sub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between successive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be appropriately modelled as a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie algorithm. However, Gillespie’s algorithm is routinely applied to model biological systems for which it was never intended. In particular, processes in which cell proliferation is important (e.g. embryonic development, cancer formation) should not be simulated naively using the Gillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature of the cell cycle breaks the Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle times is far less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same mean. Here we suggest a method of modelling the cell cycle that restores the memoryless property to the system and is therefore consistent with simulation via the Gillespie algorithm. By breaking the cell cycle into a number of independent exponentially distributed stages, we can restore the Markov property at the same time as more accurately approximating the appropriate cell cycle time distributions. The consequences of our revised mathematical model are explored analytically as far as possible. We demonstrate the importance of employing the correct cell cycle time distribution by recapitulating the results from two models incorporating cellular proliferation (one spatial and one non-spatial) and demonstrating that changing the cell cycle time distribution makes quantitative and qualitative differences to the outcome of the models. Our adaptation will allow modellers and experimentalists alike to appropriately represent cellular proliferation—vital to the accurate modelling of many biological processes—whilst still being able to take advantage of the power and efficiency of the popular Gillespie algorithm.}},

We develop a three-phase model that distinguishes a latency phase, accounting for non-divided cell behaviour, a resting phase and the active phase of the division process. Parameter estimates are derived from model results, and numerical simulations are then compared to the dynamics of in vitro experiments, with different biological assumptions tested. Our model allows us to compare the dynamics of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and to highlight their kinetic differences.

Here we show that individual T-cell clones resulting from controlled stimulation in vitro are strongly lineage imprinted with highly correlated expansion fates. Progeny from clonal families cease dividing in the same or adjacent generations, with inter-clonal variation producing burst-size diversity. The effects of costimulatory signals on individual clones sum together with stochastic independence; therefore, the net effect across multiple clones produces consistent, but heterogeneous population responses.

The changing pattern of the level of Myc was not affected by cell division, which identified the regulating mechanism as a cell-intrinsic, heritable temporal controller. Overexpression of Myc in stimulated T cells and B cells did not sustain cell proliferation indefinitely, as a separate 'time-to-die' mechanism, also heritable, was programmed after lymphocyte activation and led to eventual cell loss. Together the two competing cell-intrinsic timed fates created the canonical T cell and B cell immune-response pattern of rapid growth followed by loss of most cells.

Combining modeling and experimentation, we found that NF-κB cRel enforces the execution of a cellular decision between mutually exclusive fates by promoting survival in growing cells.

This result is inconsistent with models that assume independent times for consecutive phases.

Upon reaching a threshold concentration, the signalling molecule activates the QS-controlled genes that promote phenotypic changes. This mechanism, for its simplicity, has become the model system for studying the emergence of a global response in prokaryotic cells. Yet, how cells precisely measure the signal concentration and act coordinately, despite the presence of fluctuations that unavoidably affects cell regulation and signalling, remains unclear. We propose a model for the QS signalling mechanism in Vibrio fischeri based on the synthetic strains lux01 and lux02. Our approach takes into account the key regulatory interactions between LuxR and LuxI, the autoinducer transport, the cellular growth and the division dynamics. By using both deterministic and stochastic models, we analyze the response and dynamics at the single-cell level and compare them to the global response at the population level. Our results show how fluctuations interfere with the synchronization of the cell activation and lead to a bimodal phenotypic distribution. In this context, we introduce the concept of precision in order to characterize the reliability of the QS communication process in the colony. We show that increasing the noise in the expression of LuxR helps cells to get activated at lower autoinducer concentrations but, at the same time, slows down the global response. The precision of the QS switch under non-stationary conditions decreases with noise, while at steady-state it is independent of the noise value. Our in silico experiments show that the response of the LuxR/LuxI system depends on the interplay between non-stationary and stochastic effects and that the burst size of the transcription/translation noise at the level of LuxR controls the phenotypic variability of the population. These results, together with recent experimental evidences on LuxR regulation in wild-type species, suggest that bacteria have evolved mechanisms to regulate the intensity of those fluctuations.}},

Altering the stimulus strength regulates the outcome in a quantal manner by varying the number of cells that participate in the response. In contrast, the T-cell-dependent CD40 activation signal induces a response where division times and differentiation rates vary in relation to stimulus strength.

High cell-to-cell variability and technical noise pose challenges for interpreting popular dye-dilution experiments objectively. It remains an unresolved challenge to avoid under- or over-interpretation of such data when phenotyping gene-targeted mouse models or patient samples. Here we develop and characterize a computational methodology to parameterize a cell population model in the context of noisy dye-dilution data. To enable objective interpretation of model fits, our method estimates fit sensitivity and redundancy by stochastically sampling the solution landscape, calculating parameter sensitivities, and clustering to determine the maximum-likelihood solution ranges. Our methodology accounts for both technical and biological variability by using a cell fluorescence model as an adaptor during population model fitting, resulting in improved fit accuracy without the need for ad hoc objective functions. We have incorporated our methodology into an integrated phenotyping tool, FlowMax, and used it to analyze B cells from two NFκB knockout mice with distinct phenotypes; we not only confirm previously published findings at a fraction of the expended effort and cost, but reveal a novel phenotype of nfkb1/p105/50 in limiting the proliferative capacity of B cells following B-cell receptor stimulation.

abstract = {{In most biological studies and processes, cell proliferation and population dynamics play an essential role. Due to this ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. While the simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. In this work, we present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete division number and continuous label dynamics. Thus, it allows for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and can be shown to be a generalization of most existing models used to describe these data. We prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a set of decoupled PDEs, which drastically reduces the computational effort for simulating the model. Furthermore, the PDEs are solved analytically and the ODE system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of ODEs. In addition to modeling the label dynamics, we link the label-induced fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. Furthermore, we provide an analytical approximation for the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral. This is illustrated by modeling and simulating a proliferating population with division number-dependent proliferation rate.}},

The intracellular dye CFSE is a powerful experimental tool for the analysis of a population of dividing cells, and numerous mathematical treatments have been aimed at using CFSE data to describe an immune response [30,31,32,37,38,42,48,49]. Recently, partial differential equation structured population models, with measured CFSE fluorescence intensity as the structure variable, have been shown to accurately fit histogram data obtained from CFSE flow cytometry experiments [18,19,52,54]. In this report, the population of cells is mathematically organized into compartments, with all cells in a single compartment having undergone the same number of divisions. A system of structured partial differential equations is derived which can be fit directly to CFSE histogram data. From such a model, cell counts (in terms of the number of divisions undergone) can be directly computed and thus key biological parameters such as population doubling time and precursor viability can be determined. Mathematical aspects of this compartmental model are discussed, and the model is fit to a data set. As in [18,19], we find temporal and division dependence in the rates of proliferation and death to be essential features of a structured population model for CFSE data. Variability in cellular autofluorescence is found to play a significant role in the data, as well. Finally, the compartmental model is compared to previous work, and statistical aspects of the experimental data are discussed.}},

abstract = {{Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslashepsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslashepsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.}},

A number of independent studies have developed mathematical models as well as parameter estimation methods to better understand cell cycle kinetics based on CFSE data. However, when applying different models to the same data set, notable discrepancies in parameter estimates based on different models has become an issue of great concern. It is therefore important to compare existing models and make recommendations for practical use. For this purpose, we derived the analytic form of an age-dependent multitype branching process model. We then compared the performance of different models, namely branching process, cyton, Smith-Martin, and a linear birth-death ordinary differential equation (ODE) model via simulation studies. For fairness of model comparison, simulated data sets were generated using an agent-based simulation tool which is independent of the four models that are compared. The simulation study results suggest that the branching process model significantly outperforms the other three models over a wide range of parameter values.

Mathematically the function of each mechanism can be expressed as a probability density function for the time for the particular event to occur, and it is the parameters that define these distributions that are the free parameters of the model. We formulate the problem as a branching process, and derive an expression for the probability generating function for the number of live cells of each type in all divisions, as a function of time. This allows the calculation of arbitrary moments for the live cell numbers, giving quantification not just of the mean system behaviour, but of the random fluctuations that are a consequence of the stochasticity of the underlying mechanisms.}},

The data also show a high level of correlation in the ultimate number of divisions achieved by cells within the same clone. Such correlations are often ignored in mathematical models of cell dynamics as they violate a standard assumption in the theory of branching processes, that of the statistical independence of cells. In this article we present a model in which these correlations can be incorporated, and have used this model to study the effect of these correlations on the population dynamics of a system of cells. We found that correlation in the division times between parents and their progeny can alter the mean population size of clones within the system, while all of the correlations can affect the variance in the sizes of different clones. The model was then applied to experimental data obtained from time-lapse video microscopy of a system of CpG stimulated B lymphocytes and it was found that inclusion of the correct correlation structure is necessary to accurately reproduce the observed population dynamics. We conclude that correlations in the dynamics of cells within an ensemble will affect the population dynamics of the system, and the effects will become more pronounced as the number of divisions increases.}},

The data used, thus far, to inform understanding of these processes, both in vitro and in vivo, are taken from flow cytometry experiments. One significant drawback of flow cytometry is that individual cells cannot be tracked, so that it is not possible to investigate interdependencies in the fate of cells within a family tree. This deficit in experimental information has recently been overcome by Hawkins et al. (Hawkins et al. 2009 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 106, 13 457-13 462 (doi:10.1073/pnas.0905629106)), who reported on time-lapse microscopy experiments in which B-cells were stimulated through the TLR-9 receptor. Cells stimulated in this way do not aggregate, so that data regarding family trees can be recorded. In this article, we further investigate the Hawkins et al. data. Our conclusions are striking: in order to explain the familial correlation structure in division times, death times and propensity to divide, a minimum of two distinct heritable factors are necessary. As the data show that two distinct factors are necessary, we develop a stochastic model that has two heritable factors and demonstrate that it can reproduce the key features of the data. This model shows that two heritable factors are sufficient. These deductions have a clear impact upon biological understanding of the adaptive immune response. They also necessitate changes to the fundamental premises behind the tools developed by statisticians to draw deductions from flow cytometry data. Finally, they affect the mathematical modelling paradigms that are used to study these systems, as these are widely developed based on assumptions of cellular independence that are not accurate.}},

abstract = {{In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to \$2\textbackslashlambda/n\$, where \$\textbackslashlambda\$ is the real log canonical threshold and \$n\$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.}},

Using a rigorous mathematical framework, we show that two commonly used models that are based on the theories of age-structured cell populations and of branching processes, are mathematically identical.

We confirm that our analytic form for the number of cells in each division class is consistent with the numerical solution of a set of delay differential equations representing the generalized Smith–Martin model with cell death rates depending on the division class. Choosing the distribution of time to the first division to fit thymidine labeling data for B cells stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and either with or without interleukin-4 (IL-4), we fit CFSE data to determine the dependence of B cell kinetic parameters on the presence of IL-4. We find when IL-4 is present, a greater proportion of cells are recruited into division with a longer average time to first division.

These B cells undergo phases typical of an adaptive response, dividing up to 6 times before losing the impetus for further growth and division and eventually dying by apoptosis. Using long-term microscopic imaging, accurate histories of individual lymphocyte fates were collected. Quantitative analysis of family relationships revealed that times to divide of siblings were strongly related but these correlations were progressively lost through consecutive divisions. A weaker, but significant, correlation was also found for death times among siblings. Division cessation is characterized by a loss of cell growth and the division in which this occurs is strongly inherited from the original founder cell and is related to the size this cell reaches before its first division. Thus, simple division-based dilution of factors synthesized during the first division may control the maximum division reached by stimulated cells. The stochastic distributions of times to divide, times to die, and divisions reached are also measured. Together, these results highlight the internal cellular mechanisms that control immune responses and provide a foundation for the development of new mathematical models that are correct at both single-cell and population levels.}},

Based on extensive flow cytometry data, Hawkins et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:5032-5037, 2007) introduced a cell-level stochastic model of lymphocyte population dynamics, called the Cyton Model, that accurately captures mean lymphocyte population size as a function of time. In Subramanian et al. (J Math Biol 56(6):861-892, 2008), we performed a branching process analysis of the Cyton Model and deduced from parameterizations for in vitro and in vivo data that the immune response is predictable despite each cell's fate being highly variable. One drawback of flow cytometry data is that individual cells cannot be tracked, so that it is not possible to investigate dependencies in the fate of cells within family trees. In the absence of this information, while the Cyton Model abandons one of the usual assumptions of branching processes (the independence of lifetime and progeny number), it adopts another of the standard branching processes hypotheses: that the fates of progeny are stochastically independent. However, new experimental observations of lymphocytes show that the fates of cells in the same family tree are not stochastically independent. Hawkins et al. (2008, submitted) report on ciné lapse photography experiments where every founding cell's family tree is recorded for a system of proliferating lymphocytes responding to a mitogenic stimulus. Data from these experiments demonstrate that the death-or-division fates of collaterally consanguineous cells (those in the same generation within a founding cell's family tree) are strongly correlated, while there is little correlation between cells of distinct generations and between cells in distinct family trees. As this finding contrasts with one of the assumptions of the Cyton Model, in this paper we introduce three variants of the Cyton Model with increasing levels of collaterally consanguineous correlation structure to incorporate these new found dependencies. We investigate their impact on the predicted expected variability of cell population size. Mathematically we conclude that while the introduction of correlation structure leaves the mean population size unchanged from the Cyton Model, the variance of the population size distribution is typically larger. Biologically, through comparison of model predictions for Cyton Model parameterizations determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we deduce that if collaterally consanguineous correlation extends beyond cousins, then the immune response is less predictable than would be concluded from the original Cyton Model. That is, some of the variability seen in data that we previously attributed to experimental error could be due to intrinsic variability in the cell population size dynamics.}},

The cyton model for regulation of lymphocyte proliferation and survival was introduced by Hawkins et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104, 5032–5037, 2007) to provide a framework for understanding this response and its regulation. The model assumes stochastic values for division and survival times for each cell in a responding population. Experimental evidence indicates that the choice of times is drawn from a skewed distribution such as the lognormal, with the fate of individual cells being potentially highly variable. For this reason we calculate the higher moments of the model so that the expected variability can be determined. To do this we formulate a new analytic framework for the cyton model by introducing a generalization to the Bellman–Harris branching process. We use this framework to introduce two distinct approaches to predicting variability in the immune response to a mitogenic signal. The first method enables explicit calculations for certain distributions and qualitatively exhibits the full range of observed immune responses. The second approach does not facilitate analytic solutions, but allows simple numerical schemes for distributions for which there is little prospect of analytic formulae. We compare the predictions derived from the second method to experimentally observed lymphocyte population sizes from in vivo and in vitro experiments. The model predictions for both data sets are remarkably accurate. The important biological conclusion is that there is limited variation around the expected value of the population size irrespective of whether the response is mediated by small numbers of cells undergoing many divisions or for many cells pursuing a small number of divisions. Therefore, we conclude the immune response is robust and predictable despite the potential for great variability in the experience of each individual cell.}},

The method is also shown to be applicable for approximating the sum of lognormal-Rice and Suzuki RVs by a single lognormal RV. A sum consisting of a mixture of the above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation and does so without the extremely precise numerical computations at a large number of points that were required by the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the lognormal sum distribution. The accuracy of the method is measured both visually, as has been done in the literature, as well as quantitatively, using curve-fitting metrics. An upper bound on the sensitivity of the method is also provided.}},

The quantitative interpretation and understanding of such heterogenous cell population data requires the development of distributed parameter mathematical models and computational techniques for data assimilation. The mathematical modelling of label-structured cell population dynamics leads to a hyperbolic partial differential equation in one space variable. The model contains fundamental parameters of cell turnover and label dilution that need to be estimated from the flow cytometry data on the kinetics of the CFSE label distribution. To this end a maximum likelihood approach is used. The Lax-Wendroff method is used to solve the corresponding initial-boundary value problem for the model equation. By fitting two original experimental data sets with the model we show its biological consistency and potential for quantitative characterization of the cell division and death rates, treated as continuous functions of the CFSE expression level. Once the initial distribution of the proliferating cell population with respect to the CFSE intensity is given, the distributed parameter modelling allows one to work directly with the histograms of the CFSE fluorescence without the need to specify the marker ranges. The label-structured model and the elaborated computational approach establish a quantitative basis for more informative interpretation of the flow cytometry CFSE systems.}},

The fluorescent dye CFSE allows the tracking of cell division in vitro and in vivo and provides a rich source of information with which to test models of cell kinetics. Cell division and death have a stochastic component at the single-cell level, and the probabilities of these occurring in any given time interval may also undergo systematic variation at a population level. This gives rise to heterogeneity in proliferating cell populations. Branching processes provide a natural means of describing this behaviour. We present a likelihood-based method for estimating the parameters of branching process models of cell kinetics using CFSE-labeling experiments, and demonstrate its validity using synthetic and experimental datasets. Performing inference and model comparison with real CFSE data presents some statistical problems and we suggest methods of dealing with them. The approach we describe here can be used to recover the (potentially variable) division and death rates of any cell population for which division tracking information is available.}},

This model provides a powerful method for fitting and analyzing fluorescent division tracking data and reveals how summing receptor-mediated kinetic changes can modify the immune response progressively from rapid tolerance induction to strong immunity. An important consequence of our results is that intrinsic variability in otherwise identical cells, usually dismissed as noise, may have evolved to be an essential feature of immune regulation.}},

In this paper, we consider how the data obtained with the use of CFSE (CFSE data) can be used to estimate the parameters determining cell division and death. For a homogeneous cell population (i.e., a population with the parameters for cell division and death being independent of time and the number of divisions cells have undergone), we consider a specific biologically based “Smith–Martin” model of cell turnover and analyze three different techniques for estimation of its parameters: direct fitting, indirect fitting and rescaling method. We find that using only CFSE data, the duration of the division phase (i.e., approximately the S+G2+M phase of the cell cycle) can be estimated with the use of either technique. In some cases, the average division or cell cycle time can be estimated using the direct fitting of the model solution to the data or by using the Gett–Hodgkin method [Gett A. and Hodgkin, P. 
. A cellular calculus for signal integration by T cells. Nat. Immunol. 1:239-244]. Estimation of the death rates during commitment to division (i.e., approximately the G1 phase of the cell cycle) and during the division phase may not be feasible with the use of only CFSE data. We propose that measuring an additional parameter, the fraction of cells in division, may allow estimation of all model parameters including the death rates during different stages of the cell cycle.}},

abstract = {{The division tracking dye, carboxyfluorescin diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) is currently the most informative labeling technique for characterizing the division history of cells in the immune system. Gett and Hodgkin (Nat. Immunol. 1 (2000) 239–244) have proposed to normalize CFSE data by the 2-fold expansion that is associated with each division, and have argued that the mean of the normalized data increases linearly with time, t, with a slope reflecting the division rate p. We develop a number of mathematical models for the clonal expansion of quiescent cells after stimulation and show, within the context of these models, under which conditions this approach is valid. We compare three means of the distribution of cells over the CFSE profile at time t: the mean, μ(t), the mean of the normalized distribution, μ2(t), and the mean of the normalized distribution excluding nondivided cells, μ2\textasciicircum(t).In the simplest models, which deal with homogeneous populations of cells with constant division and death rates, the normalized frequency distribution of the cells over the respective division numbers is a Poisson distribution with mean μ2(t)=pt, where p is the division rate. The fact that in the data these distributions seem Gaussian is therefore insufficient to establish that the times at which cells are recruited into the first division have a Gaussian variation because the Poisson distribution approaches the Gaussian distribution for large pt. Excluding nondivided cells complicates the data analysis because μ2\textasciicircum(t)≠pt, and only approaches a slope p after an initial transient.In models where the first division of the quiescent cells takes longer than later divisions, all three means have an initial transient before they approach an asymptotic regime, which is the expected μ(t)=2pt and μ2(t)=μ2\textasciicircum(t)=pt. Such a transient markedly complicates the data analysis. After the same initial transients, the normalized cell numbers tend to decrease at a rate e-dt, where d is the death rate.Nonlinear parameter fitting of CFSE data obtained from Gett and Hodgkin to ordinary differential equation (ODE) models with first-order terms for cell proliferation and death gave poor fits to the data. The Smith–Martin model with an explicit time delay for the deterministic phase of the cell cycle performed much better. Nevertheless, the insights gained from analysis of the ODEs proved useful as we showed by generating virtual CFSE data with a simulation model, where cell cycle times were drawn from various distributions, and then computing the various mean division numbers.}},

These responses are triggered more readily in CD4+ T cells than in CD8+ T cells, which express a specific isoform of the repulsive molecule CD43.

These include the average time between successive divisions, the proportion of cells that survive and the proliferation per division. The physical significance of these measured quantities is interpreted by formulation of a two‐compartment model of cell cycle transit characterized by stochastic and deterministic cell residence times, respectively. The model confirmed that survival is directly related to the proportion of cells that enter the next cell generation. The proportion of time that cells reside in the stochastic compartment is directly related to the proliferation per generation.

How T lymphocytes vary their cytokine output during differentiation is unknown, although they are clearly influenced by the cytokines already present in the environment. Here we show that the number of divisions taken by the cells after activation is a critical element in T cell differentiation. Our experiments used the dye 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester to track cells in different divisions after activation by anti-CD3 in the presence of the differentiating cytokine interleukin (IL)-4. The patterns of acquisition or loss of secretion of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and interferon γ all varied markedly with division number. These relationships were consistent regardless of the time-dependent variation in distribution of T cells among divisions. Thus, the observed combination of complex asynchronous T cell growth, overlaying a fixed probability of acquisition or loss of a cytokine at each division can explain why T cell differentiation displays the contradictory features of being both highly stochastic and highly controlled. Furthermore, these data reveal that T cells share a common regulatory strategy with B cells, whereby changes in the class of immune response are linked to the process of clonal expansion.}},
